Capstone Two Ideas:

Idea1 -  Use React and Node to develop a real-time strategy (RTS) game with peer-to-peer multiplayer.  The focus will be on game functionality and RTS mechanics (front-end). The app will be playable for 2 players locally using a keyboard controller. A play-online option will be available using WebRTC API or similar real-time communication capabilities.

Idea2 - Build an app that allows Steam users to compare game data. This app would use the Steam Web API to list users based on filtered and selected game data. Example: A Steam user could search for users in friends list or global to compare their game progression and achievements with other players.
